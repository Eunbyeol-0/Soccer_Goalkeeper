Hi 👋 We are Inha-United !
Inha-United is a team competing in the RoboCup Soccer Humanoid League.

This repository focuses on algorithms and methodologies for goalkeeper behavior decision-making in autonomous humanoid soccer, and is based on the BehaviorTree.CPP framework.

Starting from the demo provided by Booster Robotics, we have modularized the system, extended its functionality, and continuously improved its performance through our own research and development efforts.
